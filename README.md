# CSS Positioning Demo

## Project Overview
This project demonstrates different CSS positioning techniques (`relative`, `sticky`, `fixed`, and `absolute`) by applying them to several items within a scrollable container. It highlights how each position affects the placement and behavior of the elements when scrolling and resizing the window.

## Features
- **Relative Positioning**: Moves the item relative to its normal position.
- **Sticky Positioning**: The item remains fixed within its container while scrolling until it reaches a specific point.
- **Fixed Positioning**: The item is fixed in place, even when scrolling.
- **Absolute Positioning**: The item is positioned relative to its closest positioned ancestor.

## File Structure
- `index.html`: Contains the structure and styling of the elements.
- Inline CSS: Styles are embedded within the HTML for simplicity.

## How to Use
1. Open the `index.html` file in a web browser.
2. Scroll within the container to observe how each item behaves based on its CSS position.
3. Modify the CSS or HTML as needed to experiment with other positioning or layout features.

## Key CSS Concepts
- **Positioning**:
  - `relative`: Moves an element relative to its normal position.
  - `sticky`: Sticks an element to a specific scroll position.
  - `fixed`: Fixes an element to the viewport, regardless of scrolling.
  - `absolute`: Positions an element relative to its closest positioned ancestor.
- **Overflow**: The container allows scrolling when the content overflows.
